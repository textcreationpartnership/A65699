            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Think my ſelf obliged to give thee an account, <hi>1.</hi> Why I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to anſwer this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And <hi>2.</hi> Why having undertaken to return an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, I have omitted, part, the firſt; of which, the true account is briefly this, ſince the Printers would not undertake the Printing of the whole, before the Term expired, I was contented do defer that part, which I conceived to be leaſt material, to the Term enſuing. That which firſt moved me to frame this Anſwer to <hi>T. G.</hi> was this, having peruſed this Author, and having found him laying the moſt ſcandalous accuſations and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> and <hi>Legerdemain,</hi> Falſhood and Contradiction to the Doctors charge, I knew not how to think that any perſon, who profeſſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, or valued either his credit or his cauſe, ſhould lay ſuch imputations upon others, and be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the perſon Guilty: Nor yet could I be eaſily perſwaded, that any perſon in ſo good a cauſe as ours, in which Authorities and Arguments do preſs for an admittance, and Men of ordinary Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, muſt be abundantly ſupplied with them; much leſs that the incomparable <hi>Dr. Stilling fleer,</hi> that prodigy of Ingenuity and Learning, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelf to ſuch diſhonourable Arts. Beſides I
<pb facs="tcp:102663:5"/>knew that his Integrity and ſenſe of honour was ſo great, that he muſt ſcorn ſuch ſordid dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and that it was his buſineſs to detect the Frauds and religious Cheates of <hi>Rome;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I preſumed he would not imitate her when he did confute her. Wherefore my curioſity enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to examine all that was deviſed to blaſt his Credit, and having found it to be written in the <hi>old Roman Style,</hi> and to contain nothing, but the pure quinteſſence of Calumny, I thought it cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to eaſe the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and to declare unto the World what was the fruit of this inquiry.</p>
            <p>And ſhould this work be ſo unhappy, which I hope it will not, as to rob the World of the Ingenious and Triumphant Labors af the Learned Dr. yet I have two things to apologize.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That the Dr. hath given us the greateſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he can write moſt admirable Books up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the meaneſt Subjects, and in anſwer to the moſt trifling and inconſiderable Scriblers; ſo that what ever Adverſarie he vouchſafes to anſwer, he almoſt equally obligeth and inſtructeth all that read him, but moſt of all his adverſary, whoſe Name he reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cues from obſcurity, whilſt he vouchſafes to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That with I have performed will give us this advantage to the common cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That through the ſtrength and goodneſs of it, a little inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <hi>David</hi> may worſt the beſt <hi>Goliah</hi> of the Roman Church.</p>
            <p>In proſecution of this ſubject, I have ſet down the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not from the ſayings of her private Doctors, but from her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Catechiſms, and Authentick Liturgies, that ſo I might obſtruct all poſſibility of pleading, that I do falſly repreſent her Tenets. But though I uſe
<pb facs="tcp:102663:5"/>this method, I do not think it either ſophiſtical or uſeleſs, to repreſent unto the World what are the Doctrines and Practices, which have ſo far obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to be Doctrines and Practiſes of no ſmall Credit &amp; Authority amongſt them they being held and defended by their moſt able Writers, and taught and practiſed with as much freedome in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Doctrines. And to omit thoſe many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which do not ſo immediately concern the preſent Controverſy.</p>
            <p>It is a very common and prevayling Doctrine, among the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the bleſſed <hi>Virgin,</hi> is the Mother of Mercy, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by vertue of her <hi>interceſſion,</hi> but <hi>by way of diſtribution, and of Diſpenſation,</hi> and that Chriſt having reſerved the <hi>Kingdom of Juſtice to himſelf, hath granted the Kingdom of mercy to his Mother;</hi> and that he hath given to her what <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> promiſed to Queen <hi>Heſter,</hi> viz. The half of his Dominions, or his Kingly Office: This Doctrine is delivered by <hi>Thomas Bonaventure, Gerſon, Gabriel Biel, Antoninus, Bernardinus, Gorrhan, Holcoth, Rutilius Benzonius, Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Viegas, Oſorius, Paulus Cararia,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others whoſe words are cited by Dr.<note n="*" place="margin">From p. 356. to p. 363.</note>

               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>as to be the very ſame. That the mighty God did (as far as he might) make his Mother partner of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty and power; giving unto her of old the Soveraignty both of Coeleſtial things and Mortal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 478.</note> That <hi>in the redundance of effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Grace upon the Creatures, the Lords power and will is ſo accommodated unto her that ſhe may ſeem to be the firſt in that, both Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, and Tribunal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 481.</note> And that <hi>all things are ſubject to the command of the</hi> Virgin, <hi>even God himſelf.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 482.</note> They alſo teach, that <hi>by ſinning after Baptiſme, men ſeem to have contemned and deſpiſed the Paſſion of Chriſt: That ſo no Sinner doth deſerve that Chriſt ſhould any more make Interceſſion for him to the Father; without whoſe Interceſſion none can be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either from Eternal Puniſhment or the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, nor from the fault which he hath vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily committed.</hi> And therefore that <hi>it was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould conſtitute his well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved Mother a Mediatrix betwixt us and him. And ſo in this our Pilgrimage, there is no other refuge left unto us in our tribulations and adverſities, but to have recourſe unto the</hi> Virgin Mary <hi>our Mediatrix that ſhe would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wrath of her Son.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe Doctrines and many other of the ſame Blaſphemous ſtamp, are taught and held by many <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> theſe books and doctrines are written and licenſed by that <hi>Church,</hi> and ſo have <hi>Catholick permiſſion;</hi> no cenſure ever paſſed upon them, no <hi>Expurgatory Index</hi> hath cleanſed them from theſe horrid Blaſphemies; but it is ſtill left free for any of the Doctors of that Communion to maintain and propagate them; and for any of the members of that <hi>Church</hi> to practiſe ſutably to theſe conceptions. To aſcribe all
<pb facs="tcp:102663:7"/>this power and Authority to the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin,</hi> and all this vertue to her Death, to give her the praiſes of it, and accordingly to truſt in her, to pray unto her for the bleſſings ſhe hath purchaſed, and for the diſtribution of thoſe Favours, which naturally do reſult from this advancement; and when they addreſs themſelves unto her, to uſe the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant expreſſions contained in the <hi>Ladys Pſalter,</hi> and in other books of the like nature with it. Whence it will follow,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1,</hi> That any perſon, who acts according to theſe Doctrines, and puts up theſe Petitions, doth not deviate from that Tradition, which the Catholick conceives to be his only rule of Faith <hi>(id eſt)</hi> a perſon may be guilty of horrid <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and notwithſtanding be a good <hi>Roman Catholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> It follows that no man ought to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for writing or aſſerting any of theſe Tenets, or for uſing any of the formes contained in thoſe books, for Oral Tradition cannot be conceived to condemn what is allowed and practiſed, without cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Hence evident it is, that <hi>private Catholicks</hi> may unavoidably be ſubject to theſe evil practiſes; for ſeeing in theſe matters they cannot have the judgement of the Church, and muſt not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to act according to their private judgements, what remains but that they follow the judgement of their <hi>Prieſt,</hi> which as we have ſeen, is often impious and Blaſphemous.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Hence evident it is, that neither theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor practiſes can ever be condemned by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> for to make the contrary Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets paſs into Tradition, or to make them Articles of Faith, is to empower the Church to coyn new Articles, and to pretend Tradition where it is not
<pb facs="tcp:102663:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be had: So that all theſe Bleſphemous and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Devotions muſt be as laſting as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have obſerved this method in my whole diſcourſe. <hi>1.</hi> To confirm the propoſitions which I have laid down by Scripture, and by reaſon, and then to introduce the Judgement of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Whereas <hi>T. G.</hi> is very ſparing both as to Scripture and Reaſon, and doth endeavor to ſupply his want of Reaſon and of Scripture, by ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent citations from the <hi>Fathers.</hi> This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be a very weak and diſingenious way of arguing; for, if the Teſtimonies of ſome few <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> be not ſufficient to confirm an Article of Faith, and to give us the true ſenſe of any text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he muſt confeſs, that what he thus diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth is weak and infufficient to prove what he hath undertaken to demonſtrate: but if he ſhall aſſert this method to be good and cogent, then it will clearly follow,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That the Doctrine of the <hi>Trent Council</hi> muſt be falſe, for they have certainly decreed that Doctrine which was aſſerted by <hi>Pope Innocent the firſt, S. Auſtin,</hi> and which was the current Doctrine of the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> for many hundred years. <hi>I wave the Opinion of Auſtin</hi> and of <hi>Innocent the firſt,</hi> ſaith Maldonate <hi>which flouriſhed in the Church ſix haundred years,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Joh. 6. n. 116.</note> viz. <hi>that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt was neceſſary even for Infants, the things is now unfolded by the Church, and by the uſe of many ages, and the decree of the</hi> Trent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>that it is not only unneceſſary for them, but that it cannot lawfully be given to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> It muſt be falſe which is defined by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Florence,</hi> and is received by the whole Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Saints departed before the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection do ſee the face of God in Glory,</hi> for we
<pb facs="tcp:102663:8"/>have proved, and <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that this definition was,<note place="margin">Bibl. l. 6. An. 345.</note> Repugnant <hi>Ingenti numero illuſtrium Eccleſiae Patrum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Hence it will follow that the <hi>Trent Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> and all the <hi>Roman Doctors</hi> who generally urge that of <hi>Jacob, The Angel that redeemed me from all evil bleſs the Lads,</hi> to prove that Angels may be Invocated, embrace that expoſition of theſe words of Scripture which is heretically falſe; as I have proved, <hi>Chap. 10. Sect. 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I have not entred into that deep di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute betwixt him and the <hi>Doctor,</hi> whether <hi>jubere</hi> doth ſignify to command or entreat; and whether <hi>imperare</hi> be to enjoyn or ſupplicate. I Judge it is ſufficient advantage to our cauſe, that, if <hi>Jubere</hi> and <hi>imperare</hi> ſhould not be rendred to entreat and ſupplicate, but to command, the Romaniſts muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably be guilty of Idolatry. <hi>T. G.</hi> indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that it is not the dead words, but the intention of the ſpeaker that makes them to be prayer; for otherwiſe a <hi>Parrot</hi> might be taught to Pray as well as a Chriſtian, and thence he manfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that in theſe expreſſions, <hi>Nos a peccatis om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus ſolvite juſſu quaeſumus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſſand. Conſult. tit. de meritis &amp; interceſſ. Sanctor. p. 971.</note> 
               <hi>Jube filio O foelix puerpera, jure Matris Impera Redemptori,</hi> &amp;c. They only pray to Saints to pray for us. As if a man ſhould call his Prince a Tyrant, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knave, and being brought before the Judge ſhould plead, that by a Tyrant he meant only a King, and by a Knave a Servant; and ſince it was not the dead words, but the intention of the ſpeaker that made them ſignificative (for otherwiſe a <hi>Parrot</hi> might be hanged for ſpeaking what he did) he hoped that he had ſpoken nothing which might give offence, eſpecially ſeeing he had more Authors ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to juſtify this ſenſe and acceptation of theſe words, than had the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb facs="tcp:102663:8"/>of <hi>jubere</hi> and <hi>imperare;</hi> if when the Sentence were thus paſſed upon him, <hi>Jubemus &amp; imperamus hunc ſuſpendi,</hi> he ſhould plead that it did only ſignify that they entreated him to be hanged: I ſay ſhould ſuch a plea be made, it would be as ſignificant as is this Anſwer of <hi>T. G.</hi> And all that any man can ſay againſt the Plea of ſuch a trifling Sophiſter will equally conclude againſt this pittiful defence which he hath offered,<note place="margin">Joſh. 10.12, 14.</note> and hath confirmed by a falſe citation of that place of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah</hi> which doth not ſay that God <hi>obeyed,</hi> as from the Vulgar he tranſlates it: but that God <hi>hearkened to</hi> the Voice of man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In this diſcourſe I have not waved any thing which had the leaſt appearance of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, but have returned a full (and as I hope, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory) Anſwer to all that hath been offered by <hi>T. G.</hi> and all that I deſire of him is, that if be ſhould be pleaſed to Reply he would not nibble at ſome few Expreſſions, as is the manner of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man party, but would return a perfect Anſwer to the whole, and then I do not doubt, but, he will Suffer me to reſt for ſome convenient Seaſon.</p>

And for that we have ſuch opinions of the power and ready help of Saints, all our <hi>Legends, Hymns, Sequenſes,</hi> and <hi>Maſſes</hi> did contain ſtories, Lauds and praiſes of them, and prayers to them; and this we do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together agreeable to the Saints, as did the Gentile-Idolaters to their falſe Gods. If anſwer be made, that they make Saints but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſors to God, and means for ſuch things as they would obtain of God: That is even after the Gentile-Idolatrous uſage, to make them of Saints Gods, called, <hi>Dij medioximi,</hi> to be mean Interceſſors and helpers to God.</q> This is the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102663:11"/>Doctrine appointed to be read and taught in every Pariſh Church of <hi>England.</hi> In the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixt, publiſhed 1547.

               </p>
               <p>And now to evidence the Truth and Juſtice of this imputation;<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> we ſhall firſt ſhew what is the nature of Idolatry; and what actions may be duely charged with it.

                  </note> nor did they worſhip that Sun which they conceived to be a meer Creature; nay, their miſtake, if there were any would be this, that they believed no Creature to be there at all, or elſe that Chriſt reſided in the Creature; <hi>what therefore they had in their minds and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to adore would not, nor could not be a Creature, but the true and eternal Son of God;</hi> but Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this ſenſeleſs pittiful excuſe will free the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> from this imputation, for they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be an evil Spirit, or a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but the God of all things: they did not worſhip him whom they believed to be an evil Spirit; no, when they appeared before his <hi>Image,</hi> and there addreſſed their worſhip to him, they believed no evil Spirit to be there at all; and therefore what they had in their minds and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to adore, would not, nor could not be an evil Spirit, but the true and only God. <hi>T. G.</hi> proceeds to ſay the difference then in the miſtakes is this; <hi>That the</hi> Manichees <hi>had for the formal Term of their worſhip an undue object,</hi> viz. <hi>A Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inſtead of the Creator; but Catholicks in caſe of a miſtake would have no other formal object of Adoration in their minds, but the Creator himſelf.</hi> Anſwer, 1 What means this ignorant and ſimple Tattle <hi>of the formal term of worſhip,</hi> but to amuze the Reader, and make him hope that he faith ſomething, when he hath nothing but a meſs of non-ſence to return unto the Doctors argument? <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> are wholly ſtrangers to this rude expreſſion; in <hi>Logick</hi> a material term is the word. <hi>Homo,</hi> The formal term is what the word doth ſignifie, ſo then the ſenſe runs thus, <hi>the</hi> Manichees <hi>had for the ſignification of this word, worſhip, an undue object, admirable non-ſenſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:102663:18"/>(2) What is the formal object, but the reaſon for which the outward or the material object is Adored? This being ſo, is it not clearer than the Sun, that they who had this apprehenſion in their minds, that what we call the Sun was alſo Jeſus Chriſt, and for that only reaſon did Adore it, had equally no other formal object, as they who had this apprehenſion that the Hoſt was Chriſt, and therefore did Adore it: and if the Hoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Bread, muſt not the Adoration terminated on it, be terminated on a Creature, muſt not the formal term of the <hi>Latria</hi> or worſhip which is given to it, be an undue object.</p>
               <p>If this erroneous conception will excuſe the Authors of it from being guilty of Idolatry, then firſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could not be rightly ſtiled Idolaters for worſhiping the golden Calf, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors aſſert, they did it upon this preſumption, that the Calf was God, and yet the holy Scripture doth expreſly ſay <hi>they were Idolaters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.7.</note> by doing thus, and that <hi>they offered Sacrifice unto the Idol,</hi> which ſure is little better than Idolatry.<note place="margin">7 Act. 41.</note> To this inſtance of the golden Calf, he anſwers thus, <hi>The Iſraelites believed the golden Calf to be God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 329.</note> 
                  <hi>but Catholicks (though ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be miſtaken in their belief) would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Bread for Chriſt, becauſe their miſtake would not be in taking the Bread for God, as the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>did the Calf: but in this that they conceived the Bread not to be there at all, but in place thereof the only true and eternal God; and ſo although</hi> the object (or rather <hi>Subject</hi>) materially <hi>there preſent</hi> would in ſuch a caſe be Bread, <hi>yet their act of Adoration would not be terminated formally upon that, but upon God.</hi> Anſwer, as if this alſo were not their miſtake who held the Calf to be God, that they conceived no Creature to be there at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102663:18"/>all, but in place thereof the only true and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, (for can it be poſſible that the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> ſhould conceive the Calf to be God, and not conceive that when they worſhipped him as God, they had no Creature to be the object of their worſhip) and ſo although the object materially preſent would in ſuch a caſe be the golden Calf, yet the act of Adoration would not be termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted formally on that, but upon God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5ly. T. G.</hi> proceeds to tell us in the words of Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> that <hi>if they thought Chriſt were not preſent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 329.</note> 
                  <hi>they are ſo far from worſhiping the Bread in this caſe, that themſelves profeſs it to be Idolatry ſo to do, which is a demonſtration that their Soul hath nothing in it which is Idololatrical.</hi> Anſwer, even ſo had not the <hi>Heathens</hi> thought that a good Spirit was preſent in their Images, had not the <hi>Manichees</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> thought that God and Chriſt were preſent where we ſee the Sun; had not the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thought that God was preſent where they ſaw the Image of a Calf, they would have been ſo far from worſhiping the Calf or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Sun, that they themſelves would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it to be Idololatrical to do ſo; which is a demonſtration that their Soul hath nothing in it which is Idololatrical. And whereas he proceeds to add from Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 330.</note> 
                  <hi>that before they paſs an Act of Aloration, they believe the Bread to be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated, or turned into his ſubſtance who may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be worſhipped, and they who have theſe thoughts are as much enemies of Idolatry, as they who underſtand better:</hi> it is manifeſt this doth as much excuſe the <hi>Heathen,</hi> as it doth the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> for they alſo before they paſs an Act of Adoration, do believe that what they worſhip, is the God of Heaven, who lawfully may be worſhipped; and having ſuch conceptions, they according to this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102663:19"/>argument muſt be eſteemed as much enemies of Idolatry, as were thoſe Chriſtians, and thoſe <hi>Prophets</hi> which reproved them for it, and paſſed ſo wicked and unjuſt a cenſure on them. <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> tells us that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> conceived that the bleſſed Virgin was a real Deity,<note place="margin">Apparat. 43.</note> and that ſhe had nothing humane in her, and ſo before they ventured to Adore her, they believed her humane nature was annihilated, or turned into his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance who may lawfully be worſhipped; and yet, if we may credit <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> it was no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an Idol-making <hi>Hereſie</hi> and they were <hi>Diabolical Idolaters:</hi> So that thoſe paſſages of that ingenious and learned <hi>Prelate,</hi> ſerve only to demonſtrate that the higheſt judgment, and the moſt pregnant ſubtile wit muſt ſtrangely ſhuffle, and moſt aſſuredly miſcarry, when it endeavours to excuſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from being guilty of Idolatry: when the ſame Reverend Perſon undertook to ſhew the vanity and folly of what he had delivered on that Subject to exceſe the Papiſt, when he proceeds <hi>to ſhew the grourds by which his judgment was eſtabliſhed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. p. 347.</note> no man could more apparently aſſert, or more convincingly demonſtrate what the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> alledged to free them from this Sin,<note place="margin">1 b. p. 340.341, 342.</note> would free the worſt of Heathens, For he intreats them to conſider, firſt, that no man without his <hi>own fault, can mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake a Creature ſo far as to ſuppoſe him to be God;</hi> (eſpecially not ſuch a Creature as a piece of Bread.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That when the Heathens worſhipped the Sun and Moon, they did it upon their confidence that they were Gods, and would not have given to them Divine Honour, if they had thought otherwiſe.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That no man in the world upon theſe grounds, except he that is malicious and ſpightful,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102663:19"/>can be an Idolater: for if he have an ignorance great enough to excuſe him, he can be no Idolater; if he have not, he is ſpightful, and malicious, and then all the Heathens are alſo excuſed as well as they.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That if good intent and ignorance in ſuch caſes can take off the crime, then the perſecutors that killed the Aplſtles, thinking they did God good ſervice, and</hi> Saul <hi>in blaſpheming the Religion, and perſecuting the Servants of Jeſus, and the Jewes themſelves in Crucifying the Lord of Life, who did it ignorantly, as did alſo their Rulers, have met with their excuſe upon the ſame account.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T. G.</hi> proceeds to urge from Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> thus,<note place="margin">P. 332.</note> (and truly he hath nothing worth conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his whole diſcourſe, but what is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed either from Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> or Mr. <hi>Thorndike) they who know that the God-head of Chriſt is the reaſon, for which his Fleſh and Blood is worſhipped in the Euchariſt, cannot take that worſhip for Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, becauſe his Fleſh and Blood is not preſent in the Euchariſt, as they who worſhip it there, think it is: For they know, that the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt is no Idol to Chiſtians whereſoever it is worſhipped.</hi> Anſwer, This argument is ſo ridiculous and childiſh, that I am tempted to believe this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon was deſerted in this matter by God, becauſe he had deſerted the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for ſo far are we from knowing that the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt is made no Idol by the Chriſtian whereſoever it is worſhipped, that we do know that the whole Church of Chriſt condemned the <hi>Arian, Photini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Neſtorian,</hi> and <hi>Eunomian</hi> as Idol-worſhippers, becauſe they did Adore his Fleſh and Blood, this argument therefore is built on that foundation which gives the lie to the whole Chriſtian World.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:102663:20"/>
               <p>Secondly, This argument doth as much excuſe the <hi>Heathens</hi> and the <hi>Manicheans</hi> as it doth the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> for they that know the Deity of Chriſt, is the reaſon why he was worſhipped in the Sun, have as much reaſon to excuſe the <hi>Manichees</hi> for worſhipping the Sun, upon this ſuppoſition that Chriſt was there, as they have to excuſe the Papiſt for worſhipping the Sacrament, upon a like falſe ſuppoſition that Chriſt is there.</p>
               <p>But now comes in a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 329.</note> ſo full of <hi>dazling</hi> light, that nothing can withſtand its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and thus it runs; <hi>what ever is taken for an object of worſhip, the underſtanding muſt affirm to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Catholicks in the belief of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do not in their minds affirm the Bread to be. Therefore the object of their worſhip is not Bread but Chriſt:</hi> Anſwer, what <hi>T. G.</hi> ignorantly ſtiles a Demonſtration, is ſuch a miſerable Sophiſm, ſo childiſh and ridiculous that nothing can be more: what Freſhman knows not, that a true Syllogiſm hath but three terms, and cannot poſſibly admit of more, it being built on this foundation, that <hi>quae conveniunt in aliquo tertio,</hi> &amp;c. But he hath been ſo liberal as to afford us five of ſix, and give us a concluſion from the premiſes, which never was contained in them. Let us put it into to better form, and ſee if it have any ſtrength or evidence; thus then, <hi>what ever is taken by the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick for any object of his worſhip, muſt be offirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Roman Catholick to be. But Bread in holy Euchariſt is not affirmed by the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to be.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Bread in the holy Euchariſt is not taken by the Roman Catholick for any object of his worſhip.</hi> This Demonſtration is ſo exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convincing, that we grant the whole. For though we do unanimouſly judge that Papiſts in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102663:20"/>the Euchariſt do worſhip Bread, and ſo are guilty of Idolatry; yet no man ever thought that they imagined they did worſhip Bread, or take Bread for the object of that worſhip which they call <hi>Latria;</hi> to ſhew the vanity and folly of this pretended Demonſtration, let us ſee what ſervice it will do unto the Heathens: <hi>what ever is taken for an object of Divine worſhip the underſtanding muſt affirm to be ſo, for neither the Aegyptians had made the Sun the object of that worſhip, nor yet the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>the Calf if their underſtanding had not firſt affirmed them to be ſo. But Heathens do not in their minds affirm an evil Spirit, or a Creature to be an object of Divine worſhip, but do conceive the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their worſhip to be God: therefore the object of the Heathens worſhip is not an evil Spirit or a Creature but God.</hi> This is that weighty Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration which our Author boaſts of.

                  <hi>For as the</hi> Dr. <hi>excellently argues, the reaſon of all Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration given to the Sacrament is this, that Chriſt hath ſaid,</hi> this is my Body, <hi>which words if they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Tranſubſtantiation cannot be underſtood of any other change than of the Bread into Chriſts Body; and if this ſenſe were to be put upon them, why mhy I not imagine much more agreeably to the nature of the Inſtitution?

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102663:26"/>to Worſhip the word made Fleſh, there he hath given a ſufficient indication of doing it wherever we are certain by faith, that he is ſo preſent.</hi> Anſvver, But what is this to the <hi>Doctors</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which proceeds upon this ground, that the preſence of Chriſts Body in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is no ſufficient evidence, that in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> it is united to the word; for if Chriſts Body may be eaten, and not eaten, eaten by them who have received the Hoſt, and not eaten by them who have not yet received it; If it may be under the ſpecies of Bread, and not under the ſpecies of Bread, under the ſpecies of Bread, as it is in the Sacrament, and not under the ſpecies of Bread, as it is in Heaven; why may it not be united to the word, and not united to the word, united to the word, as it is in Heaven; but not united to the word as it lyes ſenſeleſs on the Altar. And therefore the belief of Catholicks, that the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is thus united to the Sacrament, is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent motive to Adore it with <hi>Latria,</hi> becauſe I can have no ſufficient reaſon to think it true.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">P. 113.</note> The Dr. Argues thus, <hi>if the Bread be converted into that Body of Chriſt which is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically united with the Divine nature, then the converſion is not merely into the Body, but into the perſon of Chriſt; and then Chriſt hath as many bodies hypoſtatically united to him, as there are Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conſecrated.</hi> This clear perſpicuous Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſaith <hi>T.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102663:26"/>Elements (perhaps a 1000) are but one Body, and ſeeing all theſe Elements are Chriſts Body, muſt not he ſay that a 1000 Chriſts bodys are but one Chriſts body? is it not impudence and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity to cry out of hard words upon the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Conſecrated Elements,</hi> and <hi>Converſion into the perſon of Chriſt,</hi> when we are ſpeaking of that change which they all <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and ſay that it is made <hi>by Conſecration of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> or becauſe we uſe that term of <hi>hypoſtatick union,</hi> when we are ſpeaking of that union which is ſo called by all Divines that treat upon that Subject? and is delivered to us in that very word by the whole Church of Chriſt?<note place="margin">P. 241.242/</note> 
                  <hi>It doth not follow ſaith</hi> T. G. <hi>any more then becauſe the Bread the Fleſh, the Fiſh which he eat upon Earth were converted into the ſubſtance of his Body, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically united to him; it follows, That there were as many Bodies hypoſtatically united to him, as there were ſeveral meats eaten by him:</hi> no ſaith he, <hi>this Argument carries not the ſhew of probability. Rep.</hi> Sure I am, this anſwer hath but the ſhew of a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude; for the Elements of Bread are changed into Chriſts whole Body, but all the ſeveral meats Chriſt eat were not changed into Chriſts whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but only into ſome part of it; but the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is good againſt him, for as the ſeveral meats which by Converſion became parts of Chriſts Body, were not the ſelf ſame parts, but divers: So the ſeveral Wafers which by Converſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſts whole Body, are not the ſame whole Body, but divers; thus doth <hi>T. G</hi>'s. ſimilitudo turn tayl upon him. And that the <hi>Doctors</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is perfect demonſtration is moſt evident, for it depends upon this propoſition, that if one Conſecrated Element by one Chriſts Body hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically united to him, then muſt Two, be Two,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102663:27"/>and Ten be Ten, and many Conſecrated Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments many Bodys; which is a evident as this, if one Twenty ſhillings in a bag be one pound, then muſt Two, be Two pound, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Twenty ſhillings in a bag, muſt be many pounds.</p>

                  <hi>whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> In which expreſſions it is five times ſaid, that what we eat and do partake of, what is unto us the Communion of Chriſts Body, and ſheweth forth his Death, and therefore what is Conſecrated in this Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is ſtill bread. And is it not a wonder that one paſſage mentioned by our Saviour, whilſt he was alive, and had his blood within his Veins, ſhould be eſteemed ſufficient to make us all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that his whole body, and ſo his hand was in his hand, and that this Living Chriſt was alſo Dead and Sacrificed, and that his blood was ſhed before he ſuffered on the Croſs, and alſo that the ſame Body which was whole before the Eyes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102663:33"/>of his Diſciples was alſo broken for them, and many thouſand contradictions more? and yet that what the Holy Ghoſt, who knew the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviours words as well as any <hi>R. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> hath called ſo often Bread, and ſeems to all our ſences ſo to be, ſhould not be deemed ſufficient to make us think it Bread. If Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt had never ſaid that it was <hi>Bread,</hi> we might have had ſome reaſon to ſuſpect our ſences in this matter: But when it is ſo oft in Scripture affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be Bread, and is but once affirmed to be the Body of our Lord, and it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, that one of theſe two affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be acknowledged to be Tropical, that as great evidence as ſence and reaſon can afford in any caſe whatſoever, ſhould be of no effect at all or have no influence to move or to inſtruct our Judgments how to paſs ſentence in this caſe, but that it ſhould be thought as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, all other circumſtances being equal, to determine againſt the greateſt evidence of ſence and higheſt reaſon, as to determin according to the verdict of them both, is moſt apparently abſurd. Add to this, that the Apoſtles buiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this place, was to reprove thoſe perſons who prophaned this Sacrament,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26, 27, 28.</note> and uſed it as Common Bread, and ſo diſcerned not the Lords Body; and to convince them of the greatneſs of the Sin committed by their unworthy eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Bread: and therefore it concerned him the better to convince them of ſo great a Crime, and to diſcover the vileneſs of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation, to have expreſly told them, That what they thus prophaned, <hi>was the very Son of God that ſuffered for them;</hi> this being a moſt ſignal ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of their guilt; whereas to ſay ſo often
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102663:34"/>that it was Bread, was to extenuate the Crime, and therefore we may rationally preſume St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have expreſt himſelf not as we Proteſtants are wont to do; but according to the Judgment of the Roman Catholicks, had he believed as they do.</p>
               <p>God never wrought a miracle in confirmation of the Faith of any body,<note place="margin">Argum. 5. Sect. 5.</note> but he ſtill repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it unto their ſences, and made it apparent to their eyes, ears, feeling, or their experience that he wrought it; there is not one inſtance to be given to the contrary from Scripture, or any humane Writer; the Devil himſelf is not ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent as to require his ſervants to believe he works a wonder without ſome cunning ſlight to cheat their ſences, and make them ſeem to ſee, hear, or taſt, what really they do not. To this convincing evidence and demonſtration, <hi>T. G.</hi> returns this ſorry anſwer,<note place="margin">P. 293.</note> 
                  <hi>that ſuch miracles as are done for the Converſion of unbelievers, ought to be objects of our ſence, but this is not done upon ſuch an account, but for the Sanctification of thoſe that believe already, and for theſe it is enough, that Chriſt hath ſaid it is his body, they know very well the danger of not believing him more than their ſences:</hi> Anſwer, 1. We have in Scripture many inſtances of Miracles done not for the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of unbelievers, but for the benefit of thoſe that did believe, and ſuch were all the ſtanding Miracles that are recorded in the Book of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Manna, the water of Jealouſie, the <hi>

                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> to be ſomething ſenſible, whereby we do perceive what is not ſenſible, what therefore is no object of the ſence, can be no ſign or Miracle. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we cannot poſſibly obtain a greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that any Revelation is Divine, than is the evidence of ſence, whence it doth follow, that we can have no reaſon to believe a Revelation more than we do our ſences: as <hi>T. G.</hi> aſſerts; for all the certainty we have of any object of our Faith depends on our aſſurance, that the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of it were infallibly aſſiſted by the Divine Wiſdom in that delivery: and is not this atteſted by the Miracles they wrought, the Propheſies they delivered, the Doctrine they taught? and that by ſence? ſhould any of them be queſtioned, muſt not we recur unto the ſences of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians to confirm them? and muſt they not then be the ultimate foundation of our Faith, and our Traditions? muſt we not be ſurer of the proof, than of the thing proved? And conſequently of the evidence of ſenſe, than that of Faith, which deriveth from it? if not, why, Secondly doth our Lord pronounce them rather Bleſſed, who <hi>believe and have not ſeen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">20 Joh. 29</note> than <hi>Thomas</hi> who firſt ſaw and felt, and then believed? is it not becauſe they do it upon leſſer (though ſufficient) evidence? and ſo their Faith is more illuſtrious and praiſe worthy. Thirdly, ſhould it be otherwiſe, how cometh it to paſs that men are equally aſſured of what equally they ſee, but have not the like fulneſs of perſwaſion in what they believe? That being once aſſured of the objects of ſence; they can admit of no greater certainty, whereas after all our boaſts of a <hi>Plero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phory</hi> of Faith, we have ſtill need to ſtrive and labour to encrease it? Since then the certainty of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102663:35"/>Faith is proved inferior to that of ſence. It is not poſſible we ſhould have greater reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Revelation, or any matter of our Faith, than to believe our ſences as <hi>T. G.</hi> ſuggeſts: hence alſo it doth follow that we can have no greater reaſon to believe that theſe four words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> are contained in Scripture, or that they do aſſert the Sacrament to be Chriſts Body, than that aſſurance which the ſences of all Chriſtians do afford us, that it remaineth Bread. And Thirdly, hence it follows, that we can have no greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to profeſs the Chriſtian Faith, than we have to reject the Figment of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer, 3. As for that vain pretence that Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>this is his Body,</hi> and therefore we ſtand bound to think that he doth work a Miracle to make it ſo, although it be againſt the ſence and reaſon of mankind that he ſhould do it: This will oblige us alſo to believe, that by ſome other like prodigious Miracle before his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation he was Tranſubſtantiated into the Rock, which miniſtred water to the <hi>Jews</hi> during their Travels in the Wilderneſs, for of that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid <gap reason="foreign">

                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.50.</note> which yet <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> doth inherit.

                  <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> and to confeſs that all the arguments which have been urged againſt that Tenet by the Church of Chriſt are vain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, for Scripture hath not only ſaid that man was made after the likeneſs and ſimilitude of God, but alſo doth in very many places attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute unto him the parts and members of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, what then will you oppoſe againſt them? ſence, and reaſon? <hi>T.

The Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies themſelves of thoſe antient Lawyers would be conviction enough: how much more when ſtrengthned by the confeſſion of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party it ſelf?

               <p>THe Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation being overthrown,<note place="margin">Sect, 1.</note> the Adoration of the Hoſt muſt fall together with it.<note place="margin">p, 222.</note> But ſince <hi>T.

And, 1. <hi>The commandment to Worſhip God alone
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102663:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>is ſo expreſs (ſaith Biſhop</hi> Taylor) <hi>the diſtance betwixt God and what our ſenſes repreſent as bread,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſt. p. 338.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo vaſt, the danger of Worſhipping that which is not God, or of not Worſhipping that which is God, is ſo formidable, that it is infinitely to be preſumed, that if it had been intended that we ſhould have Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Holy Sacrament, the Holy Scripture would have call'd it</hi> God, <hi>or</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>or have bidden us in expreſs terms to have Adored it, that either by the firſt, as by a reaſon indicative, or by the ſecond, as by a reaſon imperative we might have had ſufficient warrant, direct, or conſequent, to have paid Divine Worſhip to it.</hi> To ſtrengthen and confirm this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument it may deſerve to be conſidered, 1. That the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> are very punctual in the Relation of what our Saviour did, or enjoyned in this Inſtitution; they all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us that Chriſt commanded them to eat the Bread and drink the Cup which he had given to them; and had he given them to be adored, would they, who mention things ſo obvious, forget to tell us that either Chriſt intended they ſhould be Adored, or that they were Adored by them? that which induced St. <hi>Paul</hi> to mention this Inſtitution, and to aſſert that he received it from our Lord, was the irreverence of thoſe that did participate,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 18, 28.</note> and their want of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to receive thoſe Holy Myſteries. To cure this diſeaſe he tells them, that the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Chriſts own Inſtitution, the charge he left behind him <hi>that very night in which he was beirayed,</hi> and that the Inſtitution was intended for the Commemoration of our Saviours death; all which is proper to beget within us a greater Reverence and care in celebration of theſe holy myſteries; but yet it cannot be denyed that this conſideration, viz. <hi>That what they thus irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102663:60"/>treated, was that very Son of God which ſuffered for them, and that it was that Hoſt which they and all good people did Worſhip for their</hi> God. I ſay, this one conſideration would have been infinitely more proper and effectual to aggravate the ſin of thoſe who ſlighted it, and irreverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behaved themſelves at the participation of this Sacrament. This therefore was omitted by St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon no other ſcore but the abſurdity and falſhood of the thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider with what expreſeneſs the Scripture doth inform us that Chriſt <hi>is God, true God, God bleſſed for evermore,</hi> and yet becauſe his converſation in the World was in the habit and likeneſs of a Man, and his Divinity was hid under the veil of humane fleſh, and becauſe this <hi>Jeſus</hi> was made ſubject to an ignominious and accurſed death, the Scripture thinks it not ſufficient to aſcribe unto him in 100 places the nature &amp; proprieties of God, and to leave us upon Record,<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.11, 8, 2, 9, 18, 15, 25, 20, 20, 28, 9, 17.</note> examples of his Adoration by the wiſe Men of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and by his own Diſciples, and by divers others. I ſay the Scriptures think it not ſufficient to have done all this, and therefore they inform us that this is the decree of Heaven, <hi>that to the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil, 2, 10, Joh, 5.23.1 Heb. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and that all ſhould honour the Son, even as they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Father,</hi> and that when this firſt born came into the World <hi>Gods Angels were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Adore him:</hi> now it is evident the humane nature did not ſo much conceal the Deity, as do the accidents of Bread, for God ſometimes did appear unto his Prophets in a human ſhape, but never in the ſhape of Bread and Wine. Chriſt while encompaſſed with our fleſh, gave ſignal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of his Divine perfections by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and by declaring that he knew the thoughts
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102663:61"/>of thoſe with whom he did converſe, but in the Sacrament Chriſt giveth not the leaſt appearance or demonſtration of his preſence; He doth not reſcue his moſt Sacred body from the <hi>Mouſe</hi> or <hi>Rat,</hi> or from the Sacriligious hands of Theives, and Sorcerers. Here then was greater reaſon to have told us as often, <hi>that the Sacrament was God, and was to be adored,</hi> as they have told us <hi>Chriſt was God, and was to be adored</hi> Since therefore we have no precept or example in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for adoration of the Sacrament, nor any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that the nature and properties of God do belong unto it; ſeeing it is aſſerted of the <hi>Rock,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.4, 6, 15.1 Pet. 2.4,</note> and of the <hi>Church</hi> that they are <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of the Saints, that they are made <hi>Partakers of the Divine nature;</hi> but it is not once aſſerted of the Sacrament that it is Chriſt, or that it <hi>partakes of his Divinity,</hi> but only that it his body; we have juſt reaſon to conclude that it neither was adored by Chriſts Diſciples, nor was intended ſo to be.</p>
               <p>If that which Romaniſts adore were truly Chriſt,<note place="margin">Arg. 2. § 2. Brevint, p. 72,</note> one might ſafely aver (what even to think were Blaſphemy) <q>That neither Prophets nor Holy Fathers in their Speeches againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Gods, either conſidered well what they ſaid, or ever thought well of their Saviour. And Firſt, to begin with their Original, when the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> inveighs againſt them who worſhip Gods made by a Carpenter, of a Tree which the worſhipers had Planted, and after hewen into pieces, whereof one was to heat an Oven, and the other to make a God. Can any rational Man think that the Holy Ghoſt did foreſee, That all true Worſhippers in the time of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> were to adore a God every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning made of, and every morning incloſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102663:61"/>ſomewhat of that Wheat that firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Men had ſown, and Bakers baked into Wafers, of which afterwards an Apothecary was to take ſome to wrap Pills in, and the Prieſt all the reſt to Conſecrate into a God? And if the taking that for a God, which before the Conſecration was but a Stock, is a Pagan blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fit for a Prophet to wonder at, <hi>v.</hi> 18. Is the adoring that for a Saviour, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the uttering of ſome few words, was a thin wafer, ſuch clear underſtanding as may become a Catholick?</q>
                  <note place="margin">C 14. v. 20.</note> The Authour of the book of Wiſdom makes the Pagan folly chiefly to conſiſt in this, That <hi>they took him now for a God which a little before was not honoured as a Man.</hi> Pagans melt Braſs, they caſt it, they ſet it up, <q>they faſten it, ſaith <hi>Minucius,</hi> tis yet no God: they poliſh it, they adorn it, neither is it yet a God: But ſee now, they Conſecrate it, and Pray to it, then as ſoon as Men will have it to be a God, it is a God. p. 26. What! were theſe wiſe men blind not to perceive, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans might return the ſame Raillery? Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they ſow Wheat, they cut, gather, and threſh it, 'tis no Chriſt yet: they grind it, they ſift it, they bake it, 'tis but a wafer: they ſet it upon an Altar, they elevate it, they croſs it ſeveral times; no wonder yet: at laſt they ſpeak five words upon it; preſently ten Miracles break forth, and among an hundred Wafers, which are all like to one another, that which they are pleaſed to think upon, is their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</q> And though a little before it was not honoured as a Man, it is now taken to be God. <q>Beſides, all the Reproaches and Ironies which Holy Prophets or Chriſtian Fathers throw on Idols, fall twenty times more heavy on what is

For the abſurdneſs of the thing to ſenſe and reaſon, is ſo great and obvious, that it ſeems plainly to require more Apologyes than they beſtowed to vindicate, and to wipe of the ſcandal of the Croſs.

In the Fourth Century, it was the chief concern of all the Fathers to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Arians,</hi> and all their under-Sects, and their chief Argument was this, that<note n="h" place="margin">commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis eſt illa S.

During Eight hundred years we have not one complaint or ſcruple that the Chriſtians God was pittiful immured and ſhut up in the ſhape of Bread and Wine, deprived of the uſe of all his faculties, and expoſed to the Teeth of Vermin, which gives juſt reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that what the Chriſtians of thoſe times did practiſe, gave no occaſion to them to diſcourſe theſe things, or to be ſcandalized with them.

               <p>And that theſe actions do partake of the true nature of Idolatry, we have confirmed both from the evidence of Scripture, the judgment of the learned Fathers, the voice of reaſon, and the confeſſion of our Adverſaries.

                  <hi>Origen, becauſe we do not worſhip Images, that thoſe things do not appertain to us, for that is God to any perſon which he prefers, admires, and loves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other things.

               <p>Secondly, This Propoſition may alſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, (1.) From the definition of Idolatry; for if Idolatry conſiſts <hi>in giving of that worſhip
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102663:72"/>which is due to God, to that which is not God,</hi> by giving it to any Creature we muſt be guilty of idolatry, it being the moſt clear and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable truth that the moſt excellent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not God. 2. Whatever doth import and ſignifie the honour due to the Ceator, doth alſo ſignifie that excellency which is only due unto him: We cannot then perform that act of honour which imports this excellency to the beſt of Creatures, but we muſt honour it as our Creator; nor can we honour it as our Creator, but we muſt worſhip it as God, and by ſo ding we muſt be guilty of what the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts confeſs to by paying honor to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But we can pay no greater honor to the moſt excellent of Creatures, than by aſcribing to it that honor which is due to God alone: and therefore by aſcribing of that honor to it, we muſt be guilty of idolatry: 4. By giving of that honor to God which doth import that excellence and perfection which agrees to God alone, we exerciſe that act of Worſhip which we call <hi>Latria;</hi> for ſince <hi>Dulia</hi> doth import on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the worſhip proper to the Creature, it cannot ſignifie that worſhip which is due to him whoſe dignity is infinitely greater than what the beſt of Creatures doth enjoy; if then we exerciſe that act of worſhip to the Creature we give <hi>Latria</hi> to it, and, in the judgment of our moſt rigid Adverſaries, to give <hi>Latria</hi> to a Creature is to be guilty of Idolatry</p>

                  <hi>is a divine and uncommunicated excellency.</hi> This is apparent 1. from expreſs Scripture te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.39. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.29, 30. <hi>What prayer or what ſupplication ſoever ſhall be made by any

Obſerve this knowledge of the heart is thus appropriated to God in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to whatſoever prayer and ſupplication ſhall be made by any man: Whence we infer, that whatſoever prayer and ſupplication ſhall be made by any man, God only knows the heart and the conceptions of the Supplicant; and therefore that this knowledge is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Saints or Angels. 3. Obſerve, that to affirm this knowledge is aſcribed to God alone, becauſe he only hath this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from the perfection of his nature; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is communicated to the Saints and Angels only by way of revelation, or by the viſion of that God, who knoweth all things: Is 1. without all ground to limit what is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally pronounced in the caſe of prayer. 2. It we admit this limitation, to ſay <hi>God only knows the ſecret of the heart of him that prayeth,</hi> hath no more of truth, than if I ſhould aſſert God only hath a being he only acts, he only knows that Chriſt is come into the world, becauſe he only
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102663:73"/>acts, and hath his being from himſelf; our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and our power of action is derived from him, and by his revelation only we do know that Chriſt is come into the world. 3. We may on like accounts aſſert. That even when the general hath paid his Souldiers, he alone hath money, becauſe what money and of his Souldiers have, was given by him; and that the Maſter only of the School of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> knows Greek and Latine, becauſe his Scholars have derived that knowledge from him. 4. If we admit of ſuch a limitation, then the excluſive term will not refer to what is ſpoken, but to that which is not mentioned; not to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, viz. <hi>the knowledge of the hearts of men,</hi> which is expreſſed, but only to the manner of that knowledge of which the Text is wholly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: Now this inter pretation gives ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and ſtrained ſenſe, as in a matter of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought not to be admitted without the greateſt evidence. Whereas the ſence we plead for is the moſt plain and natural import of the words: For it is natural to conceive the ſenſe of this expreſſion ſhould be this, <hi>thou, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, knoweſt the hearts of men,</hi> whereas if we do paraphraſe it thus, <hi>that many myriads of Saints and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

From the two paſſages of Scripture cited by him, it is evident, That albeit God ſometimes did reveal unto his Prophets the knowledge of things future, and of the ſecrets of the heart; yet is that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be eſteemed the property of God, and a ſure indication of divinity, and therefore to aſcribe this knowledge to a Creature, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not revealed it to him, is to aſcribe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity unto that Creature, and to be guilty of Idolatry.</p>

Moreover they conceived the objects of their worſhip to be the great Creator, or ſome good Spirit, which he had appointed to act as his Vice-gerent in the world; and yet becauſe thoſe Spirits which they conceived to be the Minſters of God, were only Satans inſtruments, and moſt pernicious Creatures, the Scripture repreſents them as worſhippers of Devils. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did not conceive the very Image they had made to be the true Jehovah, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> they did not think, <hi>that gold thus formed into the Image of a Calf, had really its ſeat in Heaven, and did from thence behold the dwellers upon earth;</hi> they did not really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was the great Creator of the VVorld, and conſequently that it made that very matter of which it was compounded, and that it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all the wonders which their eyes had ſeen, before it had a being; they did not all conceive that man could at his pleaſure make his Maker, or give a being to that God to whom he owes, and from whom he receives his being; and that they who were not able to preſerve themſelves, could make a being able to preſerve the World, and to confer upon it whatever bleſſing could be wanting to future Ages. Nor did the Heathens, who are accuſed of the like crime in Scripture, entertain ſuch
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102663:77"/>fooliſh toughts.

                  </note> Heathen World, and to aſſert, they did continue ſuch incredible portentous Sots for very many Ages; this were abundantly ſufficient to juſtifie the Charge. For to impute to the whole World for many Ages, the belief of many things, the leaſt of which no ſingle perſon can imagine to be true, without a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of folly, is a triumphant demonſtration that their caſe is deſperate. For ſhould any man be forced in defence of any Tenet to aſſert, that all the World did for ſome Ages paſt believe that twice two was ſix, or that every Aſs they fed was the Creator of the World; I humbly conceive we ſhould have reaſon to believe, he was ſome mad diſtempered perſon, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the badneſs of his cauſe, and his own obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, and not the evidence of truth, conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to eſpouſe a Tenet ſo reproachful to mankind. And yet this Tenet hath nothing more apparently repugnant to the ſenſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of mankind, than that which is maintained by the Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, <hi>viz. That all mankind did for two thouſand years conceive, that was their Maker which they had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, and that at pleaſure they could give a being to him, who hath his being from himſelf, and cannot poſſibly receive it from another.</hi> This therefore could not be the apprehenſion of the Jews and Heathens touching their Images and Calves; and yet I ſay, the Scripture doth expreſly ſay,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102663:77"/>the Jews <hi>asked counſel of their ſtocks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.12. Jer. 2.27.

                  <hi>That they fell down and prayed to the very Image they had made;</hi> becauſe the homage they performed to theſe Images, upon preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Deity, preſiding in them, (that being an abſurd and falſe imagination) was really performed to ſtocks and ſtones: an therefore on the ſame account this <hi>knowledge of the heart of all, that in all places pray unto them,</hi> being aſcribed to Saints and Angels, upon as vain preſumptions of ſuch a revelation which God vouchſafes not to them, muſt be deem'd to be the ſame, as if they did conceive this knowledge to ariſe form the perfection of their natures, and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count did put up their petitions to them.</p>
               <p>

For ſeeing all ſuch actions have their import form cuſtome and inſtitution by whom ſoever they are exerciſed, and whatſover
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102663:78"/>private apprehenſions he may have that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth, they muſt be thought to ſignifie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that import which inſtitution and cuſtome gives them. If any man ſhould uſe thoſe words which naturally import, according to the common uſe and acceptation of the words, that hope and confidence, that love and duty which we owe to God alone, whatever private ſenſe or meaning he may put upon them in his inward thoughts, he muſt be deemed to aſcribe unto that object, to which he uſeth ſuch expreſſions, the honor due to God. For this being the immediate uſe of words to ſignifie the thoughts and apprehenſions of our hearts, he muſt be judged to uſe them in that ſenſe which cuſtome hath impoſed upon them, becauſe, they will not otherwiſe declare the apprehenſions of the mind. Since therefore outward rites &amp; cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies have their ſignification from the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal from which our words derive it, or elſe do naturally import as much, what reaſon can be given why the uſe of words, which do import Gods Worſhip, ſhould be thought to ſignifie it; &amp; yet the uſe of Rites ſhould not be thought to do the ſame: And hence S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>) gives this reaſon why we muſt nor ſacrifice unto inferior Daemons (<hi>quia exterior a ſacrificia it a ſigna ſunt interiorum,</hi>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102663:82"/>contained, to pray unto our heavenly Father for it. 2. Obſ. This form of Prayer muſt be ſuppoſed to contain all things which are the matter of a true and grateful Prayer, according unto that of <hi>Auſtin</hi>

Our Father,</hi> let <hi>thy will be done, &amp;c.</hi> And then the import of this injunction will be this, when you pray for the advancement of Gods Glory, or the promotion of his Kingdom, or the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Will; when you ſolicite for any Temporal bleſſing, or for the pardon of your Sin; or laſtly, for the prevention of any Evil, or Temptation of what kind ſoever; when you deſire any of theſe mercies for your ſelves or others, pray to your Heavenly Father for them. 3. None of theſe bleſſings muſt be asked of him to whom the Kingdom, Power, and Glory doth not of right belong. For this is added as the cauſe or motive of making theſe addreſſes to God, and where the motive or cauſe is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the effect muſt ceaſe: Now to God only the <hi>Kingdome, Power,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> doth agree, <hi>Jude</hi> 25. We therefore muſt addreſs our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to him only for the obtaining of theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: And leaſt you ſhould object that this
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102663:83"/>Argument excludes the third and ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Sacred Trinity; let it be noted that all the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> do affirm, That <hi>the word Father in this Prayer muſt not be taken perſonally, but eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and ſo excludeth not the other Perſons of the Trinity, but thoſe things only which have not the ſame nature with them.</hi> 2. Prayer offered up in any time or place to an inviſible, and for any thing we know, a Being abſent from us as far as Earth from Heaven, doth aſcribe unto that Being the knowledge of the ſecrets of the heart: now to worſhip any Being, whether Saint or Angel, with ſuch a kind of worſhip which doth aſcribe unto it the knowledge of the deſires and ſecrets of the heart, both where and whenſoever they are conceived or uttered, is to aſcribe unto them by way, of worſhip what is not due to Saints or Angels, but alone to God, as hath been proved already, and may be further thus confirmed. (1.) If Saints departed were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the deſires of our hearts, why did <hi>Elijah</hi> ſpeak unto <hi>Eliſha</hi> thus,<note place="margin">2 Kings 2.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Ask what thou wilst before I am taken from thee?</hi> The Scripture doth affirm that he was taken up into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and therefore did behold the face of God. And <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> themſelves deny that he was held in <hi>Limbo,</hi> as they imagine other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were: being in Heaven, his love unto <hi>Eliſha</hi> and the Church of God was not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but enlarged, and therefore upon that account he had a ſtronger reaſon to ask what he deſired then before. Beſides, the Prophet being now with God in Heaven, his Prayers would more effectually prevail for any Bleſſing for his Friend: and therefore he had greater reaſon to have ſaid, had he believed this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome, Ask what thou
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102663:83"/>wilst when I am taken from thee.</hi> And therefore we have reaſon to preſume, that he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Doctrine, but rather thought that his departure would render all <hi>Elijah</hi>'s future wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and add reſſes to him vain and ineffectual. (2.) From that known paſſage of <hi>Iſaiah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham neſcivit nos, &amp; Iſrael ignoravit nos.</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> thus concludes<note n="(o)" place="margin">Si tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archae quid erga popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ex his procreatum ageretur ignorave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Deo credentibus populus ipſe ex corum stirpe promiſſus est, quomodo mortui ſuorum rebus atque actubus cognoſcendis adjuvandiſque miſcentur?— ibi ergo ſunt ſpiritus defunctorum, ubi non vident quaecunque aguntur aut eveniunt in iſta vita hominibus. <hi>De curâ pro mortuis. c. 13.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>If ſuch great Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs were ignorant of what was done towards the people that proceeded from their Loins, how ſhould the dead be converſant in knowing or helping of their friends in what they do?

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I reaſon thus, this practice doth aſcribe unto the objects of our Prayer ſuch knowledge of the heart, and ſuch a cogniſance of all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions preſented to them at all times, and in all places of the world, which we have proved to agree to God alone, or ſuch a preſence in all places which is proper to him, and therefore it aſcribeth to them the honor due to God alone. 2. If Saints departed do know the minds and inward thoughts of thoſe who put up their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to them, they have this knowledge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Revelation, or from the beatifick Viſion; but they have no ſuch knowledge either from Revelation, or from the Beatifick Viſion. <hi>Ergo.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="1">1. God doth not ordinarily reveal unto them the knowledge of the hearts of their petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: For if they do not want this Revelation,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102663:84"/>God, who doth nothing vainly, muſt not be ſuppoſed to impart it. But theſe bleſſed Spirits do not want it; for did they need this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to perceive our minds (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) the Church would not ſo confidently ſay to all the Saints,<note place="margin">Votis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camur, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite preces ſupplicum, <hi>Brev. in Com.

                  </note> pray for me, (much leſs we offer to you the deſires of our hearts) but ſometimes would deſire God, thus to reveal our prayers, and to acquaint them with the deſires of our hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God thus reveal the Prayers of the Petitioner to the deceaſed Saints, what reaſon can be given (ſaith the forementioned Author) why all the holy <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> were not invoked by the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> before our Saviours advent? and he had reaſon to make this enquiry. For (1.) It is as eaſie to Almighty God to make this Revelation to the ſouls in <hi>Limbo</hi> (that Papal priſon of the <hi>Antient Patriarchs</hi> and holy <hi>Prophets</hi>) as to the ſouls in Heaven, nor have we one example or declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that what God is ſuppoſed now to do, he was not willing to do then. (2.) Certain it is, the charity of thoſe departed <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> towards their relatives and friends, and the whole Church of God, muſt be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced by their change, they muſt be more the friends of God, and their petitions muſt be more prevailing, then whilſt they did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the fleſh: Wherefore the <hi>Jews</hi> had as good reaſon to invoke theſe <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> as hath the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> to call upon the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Martyrs.</hi> And God had equal reaſon to declare this was the duty of the <hi>Jew,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal their Supplications to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> as to declare this was the duty of the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and to reveal their Supplications to departed <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:102663:84"/>(3.) What a ridiculous office do they impoſe upon the God of Heaven by this fond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion? for when they pray to <hi>Apollonia</hi> for the tooth-ach.

               <p n="2">2. The Saints departed do not know the hearts and the petitions of their Supplicants, by vertue of the beatifick Viſion. This vain preſumption depends on this, that ſeeing God, they muſt in him behold thoſe things which in Idea are contained in him, or which his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth perceive, and ſo the refutation of this dream will be ſufficient confutation of it. And (1.) That which the holy Spirit only knows, theſe bleſſed Spirits do not know; but <hi>the things of God (i.e.</hi> his purpoſes and counſels, <hi>&amp;c.) knoweth no man but the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.11. <hi>Ergo.</hi> If then the bleſſed Spirits, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the beatifick Viſion, do not ſee the mind and counſel of God without his revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102663:85"/>why ſhould we think that by beholding of God, they alſo do behold the ſupplications we put up unto them?<note place="margin">De vita Contemp. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>

To ſtrengthen and confirm this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let us conſider, (1.) That the Fathers do from this place conclude the holy Spirit to be God, becauſe he is the ſearcher of the things of God; which Argument would be invalid, if this could truly be aſſerted of the bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. 2.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.12</note> Obſerve that the Apoſtle argues thus, That <hi>as no man knows the ſecrets of the heart of man, beſides the Spirit of man within him,</hi> ſo none can know the ſecrets of the God of Heaven, <hi>but the Spirit of God.</hi> Now if the bleſſed Spirits do know the ſecrets of the heart of man, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument would be invalid; for the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> might give the baffle to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and tell him, That as the ſecrets of the heart of man are known not only to the Spirit of man, but alſo to myriads of bleſſed Saints and Angels, ſo may the ſecrets of God be known not only to the holy Spirit, but to many others. 2. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth aſſure us, That thoſe bleſſed Angels which always did behold the face of God, had not the knowledge of thoſe things which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us by the Goſpel; and that the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wiſdom which contrived that diſpenſation, was <hi>made known unto them by the Church:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 3.10. 1 Pet. 1.12</note> and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> repreſents them, as <hi>ſtooping down</hi> to view this new diſcovery; which is a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102663:85"/>ſignal indication of the falſhood of this fond conceit. That bleſſed Spirits ſeeing him who knoweth all things, muſt have the knowledge of thoſe things he ſees, and therefore of the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that are put up unto him, they being ſeen and known to God. (3.) That we may pray in faith, we muſt be certain that the bleſſed Spirits are acquainted with the deſires of our hearts; for he that doth command us to pray in faith, and without doubting, cannot be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give us certain motives of this faith: and therefore God, who never is deficient in what is neceſſary, would certainly have given both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> ſufficient revelation of his will in this particular, had he intended that they ſhould pay this homage to the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; whereas we have no certain evidence, that they enjoy this knowledge, either from Revelation, or from Viſion. And (1.) We are not certain that they behold our ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the beatifick Viſion; for many of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do hold the contrary, and it is free for all her members ſo to do, and ſo this matter cannot be held as any Article of faith, or certain definition of the Church. 2. It is not certain that theſe bleſſed Spirits by vertue of this Viſion do behold what is contingent, for this is generally denied by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors, and yet theſe things are ſeen of God as clearly as are the ſecrets of the heart. (2.) We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be certain that God doth reveal them; for we cannot certainly conclude it from his Attributes, nor have we any certain revelation that he doth reveal our minds and thoughts unto them: for if we can certainly conclude it from his Attributes, then God would not be God, did he not thus reveal our
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102663:86"/>ſupplications to the Saints departed. And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Then to deny this Revelation, would be to ſin againſt the light of nature; and then not only <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but the prevailing part of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> muſt ſin againſt the light of nature, by holding they obtain this knowledge, not by Revelation, but from the Viſion of that God who knoweth all things: but if by vertue of ſome Revelation, we are aſſured that our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions are revealed to the Saints, why do they not produce it? Why doth <hi>T. G.</hi> confeſs, that <hi>Auſtin</hi> and others of the ancient Fathers, were uncertain what to determine in this caſe? Why do the greater part of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny what they have certain Revelation for? 3. Where is this Revelation to be found? In Scripture? No, they confeſs that this is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilent in this matter, and give us many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why it was not mentioned in holy Writ. Have we this Revelation from Tradition? Why then do the prevailing part of <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks reject it?</hi> Sith then we have no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of what this practice doth ſuppoſe, either from Revelation, or from the beatifick Viſion, we muſt be guilty of Idolatry, by our compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with this practice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this is the concurrent judgment of the Fathers, and that they judged all ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to inviſible and abſent Beings to attribute Gods Worſhip to them, may be evinced from two Conſiderations: 1.

               <p n="4">4. It is the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Saints departed may, and ſhould be invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, as well by <hi>mental,</hi> as by <hi>vocal</hi> Prayer. This was decreed at <hi>Trent;</hi> this <hi>Paſtors</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to teach their People; and laſtly, this we have confirmed by their practice in theſe words, <hi>With the deſires of our hearts we pray unto you, regard the ready ſervice of our minds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe Practices and theſe Petitions are many of them built upon this ſuppoſition, that the Bleſſed Saints do hear our prayers, and are acquainted with our hopes, and with the praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es which we offer to them; and conſequently the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in whoſe ſolemnities theſe prayers are uſed, muſt be deemed to aſcribe this knowledge to them. For what more fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and abſurd than conſtantly to call upon them to <hi>bear, behold,</hi> and to <hi>receive,</hi> to <hi>regard, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> and <hi>promote</hi> our prayers; when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, to <hi>pity,</hi> and conſider them that pray, to be their Advocates, and plead their cauſes, if theſe addreſſes be not underſtood by thoſe <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirits</hi> to whom they are particularly dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? Who knows not that to be our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, is to commend our cauſe to God, and to entreat that our deſires may be granted? And
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102663:95"/>who knows not that our cauſe cannot be thus commended, or our diſires repreſented, till they firſt be underſtood? Moreover, ſeeing they do requeſt theſe <hi>Bleſſed Spirits</hi> to receive their vows, and to take care that they be paid to God, to hear and to receive their praiſes; ſeeing they do conſeſs their ſins unto them, and therefore do entreat them to intercede with God in their behalf; ſeeing they do endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to move them to commiſerate their ſtate, by ſaying, that they place their <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>only confidence</hi> upon their interceſſion, they maſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that theſe <hi>Bleſſed Spirits</hi> are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their confeſſions and their vows, their hopes and praiſes: and therefore albeit this conſequence ſhould be denied.<note place="margin">T. G. p.</note> 
                  <hi>We pray unto the Saints departed, therefore they do hear us,</hi> yet this can never be denied, <hi>We pray unto them to hear, and to receive our prayers and praiſes, vows and confeſſions,</hi> and therefore we believe they do.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence it is manifeſt, that Papiſts do not only pray unto them, to intercede with God for bleſſings, but do deſire that the Bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits would themſelves confer them. Thus they entreat St. <hi>Peter by the power given to him, to unty the bonds of their iniquity;</hi> and the Apoſtles to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them from their ſins <hi>by their command;</hi> and to their <hi>Guardian Angel</hi> they ſpeak thus, <hi>Take hold of ſword and buckler, and riſe up to help me, ſay unto my ſoul, I am thy ſalvation.</hi> And therefore that they only do entreat them to pray for and with us, is a great untruth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seeing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> allows of <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Prayers</hi> addreſſed to the Saints; ſeeing their Lyturgy ſpeak thus, <hi>With the deſires of our hearts we pray unto you, receive the ready ſervice of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102663:96"/>our minds;</hi> ſeeing they do inſtruct us in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and upon all occaſions, to fly unto their help and ſuccour; ſeeing they do aſcribe unto them the knowledge not only of their vows and praiſes, but of their inward hopes, they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently do aſcribe unto them the knowledge of the heart, and the internal motions of every ſupplicant, as far as theſe petitions and other actions do require it. This is that Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which we think juſtly charged with Idolatry.</p>
               <p>For 1. To aſcribe unto the Saints departed by way of worſhip, that excellency which is proper to God, is Idolatry; but to aſcribe unto them by an act of worſhip, the knowledge of the hearts of them that pray unto them, is to aſcribe unto them that excellency which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God, by <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

If then the Invocation of the Saints departed, and eſpecially of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> be ſo highly profitable to theſe ends, why ſhould theſe men, I ſay, be ſilent in this matter, who being guided by the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> could not forget to do it, and being as concerned for the <hi>Churches</hi> welfare, as the <hi>Trent Fathers,</hi> could not for want of zeal unto Gods glory, or the good of Souls, neglect to charge <hi>all Paſtors di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to inſtruct the people</hi> in this moſt profitable and pious practiſe? Why ſhould theſe men, who both by precept and example do inſtruct us to requeſt the prayers of living friends, be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both in precept and example to move us to requeſt the more prevailing prayers of Bleſſed Spirits? they who command us when we are infirm to have recourſe unto the prayers of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and <hi>to pray for one another,</hi> becauſe the <hi>fervent ſupplication of a righteous man availeth much,</hi> why ſhould they never ſend us to the <hi>B.

Nay, they had the greater
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102663:99"/>reaſon to inculcate this, becauſe it was a novel practiſe, and never uſed by the <hi>Jewiſh Church;</hi> and therefore they had need of an Expreſs to move and to encourage them to ſuch devotions: Whereas it was the daily cuſtom of all <hi>Jews</hi> to put up their petitions to the God of Heaven.

To conclude, If this Invocation were ſo beneficial to mankind, and was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to Gods honour, it might be well preſumed, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles would have been careful to inſtruct us in it, for they neither wanted knowledge to perceive the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or love ſufficient to engage them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with it.</p>

                  </q> And accordingly we ſay, That if any perſon praying to theſe Saints was heard, it was not for the merit of this prayer conſidered as directed to the Saints, but for the affection of his heart, and as it will not follow that it was lawful for the Jew to pray in thoſe high places, or for the Chriſtian to pray in the memorials of Hereticks, becauſe that they who prayed there were ſometimes heard: So neither doth it follow that it is lawful to pray unto the Saints departed, becauſe of ſome few inſtances that they who have thus prayed, have received the deſired Bleſſing.</p>

It is apparent from what we we have diſcourſed, that it is in vain to put up theſe Petitions to the Bleſſed Angels, unleſs we do aſcribe unto them the knowledge of the Hearts of thoſe that ſupplicate, and unleſs we do ſuppoſe them either preſent with us, or able to help us,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:102663:143"/>being abſent, and that they do accept this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice when we pay it to them, that ſo as they are deemed to be able, they may aſſuredly be willing to relieve and help us. Now to aſcribe this Knowledge to them, and upon this account to Worſhip and invoke them, is to be guilty of Idolatry. This we endeavour to demonſtrate. 1. From the Reaſon of thoſe Addreſſes which we make to God, <hi>viz.</hi> that we believe him to be the ſearcher of all Hearts, one that doth ſee the inward Motions of the Soul, and is acquainted with our moſt ſecret thoughts and actions: Now this we have already proved, to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency ſo proper to the God of Heaven, that it is not ordinarily communicated unto <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> and therefore to aſcribe this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to them, is to aſcribe unto them, what is Gods propriety, and conſequently to be guilty of Idolatry by Prop. 1.

Whence we may very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, it was not out of fear of any proneneſs of that people to this Idolatry, that he did not enjoyn this practice, but only becauſe he is <hi>a jealous god,</hi> and will not give his honour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Againſt the Worſhip of an Image, or of the Hoſt of Heaven, or any other Gods, which by the <hi>Heathens</hi> were ſtill worſhipped
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:102663:148"/>under ſome viſible repreſentation, we have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Cautions, and very dreadful threatnings in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets;</hi> but againſt this Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of Worſhiping thoſe ſpirits, which in their nature are inviſible, thoſe writings give us not one Caution or Prohibition, though they do often call them <hi>Gods,</hi> of which affair I am not able to conceive a better Reaſon then this is, that it was juſt matter of ſuſpition, that this rude heavy people might be prone to worſhip what they ſaw: but it was not to be feared that they ſhould worſhip what was inviſible and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did appear; and hence we find this people continually revolting from the inviſible <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Deities: but never do we find them in the leaſt inclined to the worſhip of theſe bleſſed ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Moreover if we do conſider that in the whole New Teſtament,<note place="margin">§ 8.</note> we have not any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to enjoyn; Example to commend, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to encourage us unto this Invocation, we have a further reaſon to believe, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles diſapproved of it, for can we think that Chriſt himſelf, and all his Servants and Apoſtles, would have neglected to commend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us ſome way or other, that Invocation which they themſelves approved, and if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not deceive us, did know to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding profitable for the Church of Chriſt. For, 1. We cannot without Blaſphemy conceive, that Chriſt or his Apoſtles wanted the knowledge of that great advantage which Chriſtians might receive, by vertue of this ſupplication; it is no derogation I conceive from <hi>T. G.</hi> or his <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans,</hi> to ſay, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles knew, as well as they, what were the proper motives
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:102663:148"/>to this practiſe, and what were the benefits it could bring to the Chriſtian ſupplicant: nor yet to ſay that they as heartily deſired the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Church as doth <hi>T.

               <p>

                  <hi>This Mediation cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed but by a middle perſon, who partakes of ſome what that makes him like unto hoth parties: and therefore cannot be performed by good Angels, ſuch as the</hi> Platoniſt <hi>aſſerts theſe Daemons are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Good Angels have happineſs and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with God, but neither miſery nor mortality by which they may agree with Man.</hi> This is his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument even in that place, whence Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> doth cite theſe words, that <hi>thoſe who are Chriſtians do believe, that we need not many, but one Mediator, and that ſuch a one, by whoſe participation we are made happy,</hi> i. e. <hi>the word of God not made, but by whom all things were made.</hi>

                  <hi>by whoſe participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are made happy,</hi> that is, <hi>a Mediator of Redemption, and not a Mediator of Interceſſion,</hi> Rep. it is as plain that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch a Mediator, <hi>who is the word of God, not made but making all things,</hi> and that the <hi>Platoniſt</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his Mediating <hi>Demons,</hi> to be made by God; the <hi>Platoniſt</hi> may therefore with <hi>T.

Doth not St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tell us in the begining of this Book, that ſeeing ſome Philoſophers affirmed, that their Good <hi>Demons</hi> were Miniſters to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with God, or carry up our Prayers to him, and to bring back his Bleſſings unto us, therefore he would enter upon this diſpute, <hi>whether the worſhip of thoſe many Gods was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to Salvation.</hi> And therefore it is evident he ſtood obliged to ſhew they did not contribute to our Salvation, by being Mediators of <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> for us, as well as to exclude them from from being <hi>Mediators</hi> of <hi>Redemption.</hi>

G.</hi> ſaw this and knew that if the Doctors Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been propounded thus he could have nothing to object againſt it: And therefore that he might be able to frame ſome colour of an Anſwer he makes the Doctor ſpeak as if he did affirm <q>there was no difference between the Aegyptian Daemons or Aethereal Gods,<note place="margin">p. 362.</note> and the Saints deceaſed, but in the names: or between the Aegyptians addreſſes to theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and thoſe of the Catholicks to the holy Saints and Angels, but in the language; and that there needed no more but to correct the names as you would do faults in Printing; <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>Chnumen</hi> to read <hi>Raphael,</hi> for <hi>Chnaach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numen, Apollonia,</hi> for <hi>Gnat Sebaſtian,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

No Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt can be preſumed to confeſs, according to the principles of his profeſſion, that it was either rational to pray to evil Spirits, or to bare words and names: and therefore when he brings him in aſſerting that the thing was rational which <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaid, only the names were to be changed, he cannot be conceived to mean it otherwiſe than thus <hi>it is rational we ſhould pray for health, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that we do not do it to theſe evil Spirits which are called by the names of</hi> Cnat <hi>and</hi> Sicat, <hi>but to thoſe bleſſed Spirits which in our Lyturgies are called</hi> Raphael, Apollonia, Sebaſtian <hi>and</hi> Roach. 2 Of theſe two things the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of this practice the Doctor was ſo far from mocking at or making it the ſubject of his mirth, as doth <hi>Arnobius,</hi> that it is barely mentioned by the Doctor without the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on it, that unleſs to mention be to expoſe this practice to deriſion, the Doctor cannot without the greateſt falſhood be accuſed of it; and if it be ſo, this guilt falls heavy on <hi>T.

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:102663:181"/>but what <hi>T. G.</hi> had undertaken to make good from this Citation,<note place="margin">p. 445.</note> 
                  <hi>That St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>held, that formal Invocation, was a part of the worſhip due to Saints.</hi> This ſhall diſappear. <hi>But then again, who ſeeth not ſaith</hi> T. G. that for fear the Reader ſhould ſee this; <hi>the Dr. moſt. conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently left out of his Citation, thoſe words of</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, <hi>which were moſt material to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> viz. <hi>That the</hi> Decree <hi>was made, to forbid direct praying to Saints at the Altar, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in his opinion, why thoſe Fathers made that Decree, was to reſtrain the force of an evil Cuſtom, which they could not totally repreſs? for had theſe words been put down, the thing had been too clear to be denied, viz.</hi> that Calvin acknowledged there was ſuch a Cuſtome at that time: where firſt the Dr is introduced as one denying that <hi>Calvin</hi> did acknowledge, that there was ſuch a Cuſtome at that time, whereas he manifeſtly confeſſeth what <hi>T.

This alſo is a loud untruth, as will appear by ſetting down the Doctors words, and by comparing of them with the words of <hi>Calvin,</hi> as they are repreſented in <hi>T. G.</hi> and they are theſe; <hi>That the Council of</hi> Carthage <hi>did forbid praying to Saints, leſt the publick Prayers ſhould he corrupted by ſuch kind of Addreſſes, Holy Peter, pray for us.</hi> And again, <hi>the Council did condemn and forbid thoſe Prayers, which were in uſe by ſome of the People:</hi> And now what is there is the words of <hi>Calvin</hi> Tranſlated by <hi>T. G.</hi> which is not contained in
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:102663:181"/>the words of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi> Theſe things I have collected, not that I take delight in the diſcovery of this unchriſtian ſpirit of Calumny. I can aſſure <hi>T. G.</hi> it is no ſmall Grief to me to find a Dr. of Divinity, ſo prone to wound his Conſcience, and expoſe his credit to the cenſure of diſcerning Men. I am afflicted that the Atheiſt ſhould have ſuch great Temptations, to ſuſpect that we are guilty of the like inſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in managing of the Chriſtian cauſe againſt him; or that the people ſhould have ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to cry out, behold the falſhood of our Prieſts; ſee here what little reaſon we can have to credit any thing they ſay; ſince what they confidently avouch in the face of the World, is ſo unconſcionably falſe and full of Calumny: But I intreat them to conſider, we have great reaſon to ſuſpect, tis the unhappy principles of the Roman party, which do betray them to this evil practice. They think it lawful to equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and lye to thoſe they are pleaſed to call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and to promote the Cauſe of Holy Church by ſuch unchriſtian Arts.

That the Reader may ſee what diſingenuity is here inſinuated, it is ſufficient only to advertiſe him that we do not accuſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as guilty of Idolatry, for holding what ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers in the words now cited, but for holding what ſhe inſinuates in the words which follow, and which <hi>T. G.</hi> thought moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to conceal, <hi>viz. That every perſon may pray unto them, and that not only with vocal, but with mental prayer;</hi> and for enjoyning the ſick, <hi>to pray with his heart when he cannot do it with his mouth, O all ye Saints intercede for me, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour me.</hi> 
                  <q>What we <hi>teach,</hi> ſaith he, and <hi>do</hi> in this matter, is to <hi>deſire</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven to <hi>pray for us,</hi> as we deſire the <hi>Prayers</hi> of <hi>one another</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and muſt we for this be compared to <hi>Heathens?</hi> Do we not profeſs to all the World, that we look upon the <hi>Saints,</hi> not as <hi>Gods,</hi> but as the <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that is, as <hi>juſt Men,</hi> whoſe <hi>prayers</hi> therefore are <hi>available</hi> with him? where then lies the <hi>Heatheniſm?</hi> where lies the <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Anſw.</q> it lies in praying to them with mental prayer, and in praying to their when they are as diſtant as is Earth from Heaven.<note place="margin">p. 353.</note> But ſaith <hi>T.

This he doth frequently affirm, but till he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome inſtance of this practice of praying, only with mental prayer to any Man alive, or of petitions vocal directed unto living perſons at ſo great a diſtance, his affirmation can be no better than a manifeſt untruth; but this is a peculiar Topick, of which, all thoſe who vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do endeavor to excuſe this Idol worſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are forced to make uſe of, <hi>viz.</hi> to affirm her Doctrine and practice, not to be what certainly it is, and thence conclude her not to be guilty of that crime, which could not be denied without this Artifice.</p>

The Queſtion hitherto contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted between Catholicks and Proteſtants was</q>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:102663:183"/>held to be, <hi>whether it be lawful to invocate the Saints to pray for us?</hi> and <hi>whether this were agreeable to the practice of the primitive times?</hi> But now like <q>a <hi>miſchievous Card</hi> that will ſpoil the <hi>hand,</hi> this is <hi>dropt</hi> under the Table, and all the <hi>ſhow</hi> aboveboard, is, whether it may be clone in the <hi>Duties</hi> (as the calls them) of <hi>religious worſhip?</hi>
                  </q> Thus <hi>T.

Who knows not that one <hi>medium</hi> to prove this practice to be lawful, is, that it was the practice of the primitive times, and that St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> times are inſtanced in, as a ſufficient Confirmation of that grand aſſertion. This is the very method of <hi>T. G.</hi> and theſe are his formal word, <hi>This was the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and practice of Chriſtian people in St.</hi> Auſtins <hi>time;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 25.</note> this he endeavors to confirm from that of <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and unto this the Dr. returns this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and yet this muſt not be the Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>T. G.</hi> and him.<note place="margin">§ 11.</note> Laſtly, the Dr. ſayth he undertakes to ſhew out of the <hi>Primitive Fathers, that it was the property of the Chriſtian Religion, to give Divine Worſhip to none but God,</hi> and in this ſtrain he runs on for no leſs than ten leaves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and without ever proving that <hi>Catholicks do give Divine Worſhip to holy Angels and Saints,</hi> he moſt triumphantly concludes them to be <hi>Idolaters.</hi> Anſw. The falſhood of this paſſage is ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly notorious, that there is nothing requiſite beſides the uſe of reaſon to diſcern it, for p. 146,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:102663:183"/>159. We have this triumphant Argument. <q>Upon the ſame account that the Heathen did give Divine honor to their inferior Deityes, thoſe of the Roman Church do ſo to Saints and Angels.</q> And how unhappy <hi>T. G.</hi> was in his attempts upon this Argument I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly evinced: Again the Doctor Argues thus <q>The Fathers do expreſly deny that <hi>Invocation</hi> or <hi>Prayer</hi> is to be made to Angels;</q> for ſo <hi>Origen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 158.</note> and <hi>theodoret</hi> ſpeak expreſly that <hi>men are not to pray to Angels,</hi> and any one that reads <q>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> will find that he makes ſolemn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to be as proper to God as Sacrifice is. 2. On what account ſhould it be unlawful to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> if it be lawful to <hi>Invocate</hi> them? May not one be <hi>relative</hi> and <hi>tranſient</hi> as well as the other, can any man in his ſenſes think that a meer outward <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> is more acceptable to God than the <hi>Devotion of our heart is?</hi>
                  </q> Thus the learned Doctor, and there needs nothing to convince us of the ſtrength and pertinency of this diſcourſe, but to reflect upon the vanity and weakneſs of what <hi>T. G.</hi> hath ventured to oppoſe againſt it. See. <hi>Ch.</hi> 6. <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. <hi>Corol.</hi> 3. beſides in vindication of the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Irenxus, Origen, Theodoret,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> the <hi>Deacon,</hi> and of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> I have clearly manifeſted that all theſe Fathers cited by the learned Doctor, do very evidently prove the Invocation of Bleſſed Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to be, according to their judgements the giving of that honor to them, which is due to God, and ſo is properly divine.</p>

Let any man produce in his 440 pages one conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable notion which is not uſhered in with the great names of Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> or of Mr. <hi>Thorndyke,</hi> let him point but to one ſingle inſtance wherein he ſhews himſelf a Scholar, or a man of reading, let him produce one obſervation or Authority which is not trivial and common in almoſt every Roman Pamphlet, and I will beg his pardon for paſſing ſo ſevere a cenſure on him. In ſhort, the only new thing in his book is this,<note place="margin">p. 369.</note> that he adviſes Whores to have recourſe to <hi>Mary Magdalene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, his want of judgement and dexterity in making inferences,<note place="margin">Note, that the word <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring</hi> though it be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Italick Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, is an addition of his own, the Canons cited by him only do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn us. <gap reason="foreign">

One farther inſtance of this kind we have <hi>p.</hi> 384. where he thus argues. <q>The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi> both in in the <hi>Canon</hi> 34 as alſo <hi>Canon</hi> 51. alloweth the <hi>honoring</hi> and celebrating the <hi>Feaſt-dayes</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> which is a <hi>plain indication</hi> that it intended not to condemn in this <hi>Canon</hi> the <hi>worſhip</hi> due to <hi>Angels.</hi>
                  </q> Which Syllogiſtically runs thus, they who allow the honoring and celebrating the feaſt dayes of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not intend to forbid the invocation of Angels, but the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi> do allow the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and celebrating the feaſts of the Martyrs,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:102663:185"/>
                  <hi>Ergo. Anſw.</hi> And is it not notorious that the Proteſtants allow the honoring and celebrating the Feaſt-days of many Martyrs, why therefore doth he not conclude that they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the invocation of the bleſſed Angels.</p>
               <p>Again they who are <hi>more to be honored than men</hi> are to be invocated, according to <hi>T. G.</hi> but Angels in the Judgement of <hi>Theodoret</hi> are more to be honored then men, <hi>Ergo. Anſw.</hi> and is not this the judgement alſo of the Proteſtans, why therefore did he not infer that Proteſtants do not condemn this invocation.</p>
               <p>And now conſider whether <hi>T. G.</hi> had reaſon to uſher in this inconſiderate and Childiſh tatle, with the enſuing Preface <hi>it is manifeſt that the</hi> Council <hi>of</hi> Laodicea <hi>cannot with any ſhew of probability be underſtood of that worſhip which the Catholick Church gives to holy Angels.</hi> And to conclude with ſuch a triumph, <hi>by this the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may ſee whether we had more reaſon to fear the force of this Canon,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas that which is manifeſted and plainly indicated by this whole diſcourſe, is chiefly this, that <hi>T. G.</hi> labours not only under a great want of Learning but of judgement too. But to them who know that he is an Apoſtate from the Church of <hi>England</hi> all demonſtrations of this nature muſt be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. What I have written I am humbly confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent muſt be ſufficient to convince his conſcience of that horrid action if God peradventure will give him repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth which is the hearty deſire of him who honors his <hi>Perſon,</hi> and his <hi>Wit,</hi> whileſt he detects his want of Learning and of Judgement, and refutes his Calumnies.</p>
